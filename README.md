# 📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Portfolio Project

This repository contains my end-to-end Data Warehouse and Analytics project built using SQL Server and Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold). The project demonstrates how raw operational data can be transformed into business-ready analytical models that support data-driven decision-making.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The warehouse follows the Medallion Architecture pattern:

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|----------|
| Bronze | Raw ingestion from ERP & CRM CSV files into SQL Server |
| Silver | Data cleaning, standardization, and validation |
| Gold | Business-ready star schema for analytics and reporting |

This layered design improves data quality, traceability, and performance.
